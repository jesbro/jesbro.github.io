I expect to recieve 150/180, as I feel I have created a website that uses more concepts than just those taught in class, even though I did not demo in discussion. I believe that, in addition to the required aspects of this project, I have demonstrated competency in Advanced CSS (flex, complex navigation), jQuery (menu toggle), variable scope (menu icon/toggle), and problem-solving strategies (finding resources online).
